# course-registration-system

This repo is the fine result of a 3-member final project in CS162, worth about 1 month of working.<br>

[Project requirements (assignment).](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EXQDAvl1hbWw5FImVf2zJE33aTCnS1ZVcAACebu697E/edit) <br>
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) is required to build this repo.<br>

Linked list is the only container type used in this project, as required by the assignment. Here is [our repo of a linked list template, coded from scratch](https://github.com/sxweetlollipop2912/linked-list-template).

### Known bugs
- Fail to run on Visual Studio (windows) every time. Smoothly on mac (linux) though.<br>
This is speculated to be due to some issues with `std::localtime`.
